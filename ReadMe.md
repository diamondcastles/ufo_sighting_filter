# UFO Sighting Filter
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a filter page for a user to search for UFO sightings based on a variety of variables.

## Results
The filter page successfully filters sighting results based on the date, city, state, country, and shape of the sighting. The only issue is that, given the instructions and the d3 library use, does not properly manage state for the filter and as a result, will break the filter.

## Summary
The filter page works successfully as long as the user knows the formatting needs of the input, and carefully chooses and inputs their variables. It would be recommended for this project to utilize state management in order to better control input state and keep the application from breaking.
